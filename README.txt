This docker-compose-test directory is meant for configuring 
Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter on three containers
and setting them up to expose, scrape, and present metrics 
from the local machine and from a python test function. The
simple_test_function.py file runs a simple summation program
that takes user inputs.
